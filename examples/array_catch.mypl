// the purpose of this file is to work with a more complicated data type: arrays. I declare my array in my try and then intialize it with a valid string
// I then index into the array to try to convert the value at index 0 into a Integer, in this case it should work and print "1".

void main() {
    try {
        array string x1 = new int[5];
        x1[0] = "1";
        int i = stoi(x1[0]);
        print(i);
    }
    catch{
        print("ERROR");
    }
